# Simple_Characters
Learn to make simple characters which a modular design and interchangeable texture sheet (Reference: SC_BCC)

### 1 Introduction To Section 6
+ Michael introduces the section
+ A Look at the type of character you'll be able to create
+ An overview of the learning topics in this section

### 2 Character Design Specification
+ Know what you are doing- what the outcome is!
+ Control your time
+ Stop your project ballooning
+ Know when you have accomplished your goal
+ Simple projects allow you to iterate faster meaning you can try more things.
+ Stave off boredom

### 3 Gathering Your Reference Material
+ Reminder about reference material
+ My chosen character: "The Last Hero"
+ A look at my characters features and equipment

### 4 A 3D Viewport Refresher
+ Changing your view in the 3D viewport.
+ Transforming objects and applying transforms.
+ Adding objects and the operator Panel.
+ The outliner and naming and empties for organising.
+ Pivot points.
+ Parenting and grouping.
+ Selecting.
+ The tool shelf and properties panel.

### 5 Edit Mode and Object Mode
+ Explore in detail the differences between Object Mode and Edit Mode
+ Show how to select Linked mesh data
+ Join mesh objects together

### 6 Verts Edges and Faces
+ Explore Operating on Vertices, Edges and Faces
+ See how they're connected
+ Make models with more details than before.

### 6.5 Deleting And Filling
+ Take a closer look at how to delete mesh data
+ Show what dissolve does
+ Show how to remove faces where they are not needed

### 7 Duplicating
+ Rapidly build models by reusing parts
+ Linked Duplication
+ Un-linked Duplication

### 8 Workflow- Box Modelling & Poly To Poly
+ 2 Methods of Modelling
+ Very Similar and great for Low Poly Modelling
+ Not the only way!
+ Sculpting first is an option, but not something we will cover in this section

### 9 The Mirror Modifier
+ Purpose of most modifiers
+ The modifier stack
+ Great workflow tip even if it isn't needed all the time

### 10 Loop Cut and Slide
+ Loops are critical to speedy workflow
+ Exploration of where and when you can loop cut
+ Selecting Edge and Face loops

### 11 Duplicate and Separate
+ Great for template based production
+ Very useful for getting parts of your model to fit together.
+ Separate is the opposite to join- will create a new mesh object from your mesh data selection

### 12 The Solidify Modifier
+ Creating additional geometry quickly
+ Using Vertex Groups as a control for modifiers
+ Demonstration of modifier speeding up Workflow

### 13 Intersecting Geometry
+ Discuss when it is OK
+ Discuss when it will ruin a model
+ Pros and Cons

### 14 Removing Doubles
+ Troubleshooting a model
+ When and where to remove doubles
+ Be cautious and conscious when doing so

### 15 Vertex and Edge Slide
+ Easy way to edit geometry without destroying surrounding geometry
+ Gives you better control of where vertices and edges are in a model
